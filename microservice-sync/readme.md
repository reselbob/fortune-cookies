# Setting Up the Synchronous Version of the Fortune-Cookies MOA to Run Under Kubernetes

## (MOA = Microservices Oriented Architecture)

View the architecture diagram [here](architecture.md).

---- 

Before you start, please be advised that the MOA is running inside a Kubernetes cluster. The current state of the code is that the microservices are running
internal to Kubernetes. Hence, the application is faciliating internal "fortune sending" behavior. The next version will
implement an interface that makes the application accessible from outside the Kubernetes cluster.

---- 

**Step 1**: Go to a Minikube playground on Katacoda

(You might have to login or create an account)

`https://katacoda.com/javajon/courses/kubernetes-fundamentals/minikube`

**Step 2**: Start `minikube`

`minikube start`

**Step 3**: In a second terminal window, turn on `minikube tunnel`. This will enable `minikube` to support a Kubernetes service of `Type-LoadBalancer`.

`minikube tunnel`

**Step 4**: In the first terminal window, load in this source code

`git clone https://github.com/reselbob/fortune-cookies.git`

**Step 5**: Navigate to the synchronous version of the MOA

`cd fortune-cookies/microservice-sync/`

**Step 4**: Run the shell script the creates a local Docker registry and seed the registry
with the containers representing each microservice 

`sh docker-seed.sh`

**Step 5**: Run the shell script that generates the pods and related services the make up
the MOA, Fortune-Cookies

`cd kubernetes`

`sh generate-k8s-resources.sh`

**Step 6**: Check out all went well by listing the pods and services

`kubectl get pods`

You should see output similar to the following:

```text

users       1/1     Running   0          16s
```

`kubectl get services`

You should see output similar to the following:

```text

```


**Step 7**: Wait about 10 seconds for the MOA to warm up and then check the logs of some
target pods

`kubectl logs sms -f`

You should see output similar to the following:

```text

```

`kubectl logs twitter -f`

You should see output similar to the following:

```text

```

`kubectl logs facebook -f`

You should see output similar to the following:

```text

FACEBOOK is sending a POST at Sun Aug 04 2019 17:05:50 GMT+0000 (UTC) with the body {"fortune":"You can't live on bread alone."}.
```
**Step 8**: Let's use the test consumer to access the Fortunes service.

First we need to add the TestConsumer pod and service to the cluster.

Let's do the pod:

`kubectl apply -f manifests/testconsumer-pod.yaml`

You'll get the following output:

`pod/testconsumer created`

and then the service:

`kubectl apply -f manifests/testconsumer-service.yaml`

You'll get the following output:

`service/testconsumer created`

**Step 9**: Check to make sure that the pod and service are up and running:
`kubectl get all | grep testconsumer`

You' get output similar to the following:

```text
pod/testconsumer       1/1         Running             0                         87s
service/testconsumer   NodePort    10.102.23.152    <none>        80:30827/TCP   29s
```
Notice that in this case the NodePort `testconsumer` service is `30827`. You'll probably get a different
port number, but the important thing to remember is that the NodePort port will be a number over 30000.

**Step 10:** Let's get the IP address of the Master, this will allow us to access the `testconsumer` via the NodePort.

`kubectl cluster-info`

You'll get output similar to the following:

```text
Kubernetes master is running at https://172.17.0.35:8443
KubeDNS is running at https://172.17.0.35:8443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy
```
In this case, the IP address of the Master is `172.17.0.35`.

**Step 11:** Let's `curl` against the Master IP and the NodePort

`curl 172.17.0.35:30827`

You'll get a fortune as the output, like so:

`The best things come in small packages`

***--*** Accessing the `testconsumer` using the via KataCoda HTTP.***--***

Katacoda has a feature that allow you to access a web page that's bound to port that's exposed from the cluster via NodePort. The following 
illustrations show you how to bring up the web page, enter the NodePort IP and see the output.

**Step 1:** Click the (`+`) sign at the top of the Katacoda terminal window as shown in the figure below:

![plus-sign](./images/kata-01.png)

**Step 2:** Click, `Select port to view on Host 1` as shown in the figure below.

![click-menu](./images/kata-02.png)

**Step 3:** You will be taken to a web page into which you will enter the NodePort in a small text box as shown in the
figure below:

![port-entry](./images/kata-03.png)

**Step 4:** At this point you'll be bound to the Node.js web server that backing the `testconsumer` service. Just refresh
the web page to get a new fortune.
